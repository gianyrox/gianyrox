## Description (KDP listing — 4,000 char max)

```
Four cities. Four people. The same invisible infrastructure — from Bogotá to Harare to Lagos to a rooftop in Buenos Aires.

When the old banking pipes break, the people who feel it first are the ones moving money across borders. Pablo in Bogotá sends his mother medicine money in ninety seconds for under two dollars. Mercy in Harare protects a women's savings club from fifty-six percent inflation by parking the pot in a digital dollar. Femi in Lagos closes a hundred-thousand-dollar supplier deal from the back of a parked car. None of them are speculating. None of them care about price charts. They are using stablecoins because the alternatives have already failed them.

This is what happens when stablecoins quietly become the bridge from slow money to fast money. Not the speculation side of crypto. The side that just works.

In eighteen chapters across six acts, "Your Money Is Broken" explains how a dollar on a blockchain ledger — same dollar, different infrastructure — is rebuilding the world's payment rails from below. You will learn why moving money across borders costs 3-7% and takes days, how trust forms in communities where institutions have repeatedly failed, the 5,500-year arc of money-as-debt, why on/off-ramps are the new institutional layer, and what the corridors look like when you are the one sending.

Written for the person who keeps asking "wait, but what IS this?" — and for everyone already living it.

This is not a Bitcoin book. Not a crypto-hype book. Not a technology manual. It is a field report from inside the digital dollar economy.
